# Restriction / Ligation

## What is restriction and ligation cloning?

Restriction and ligation cloning is a one of the first cloning methods used in molecular biology. It is a two step process:

1. **Restriction:** The DNA is cut with a restriction enzyme, which is a protein that cuts the DNA at specific sequences, often leaving an overhang or sticky end.
2. **Ligation:** Cut DNA fragments with complementary overhangs come together, and then a ligase joins the nick between the fragments.

Golden Gate Assembly relies on restriction and ligation, read more about it [here](./golden_gate.md).

## How to separately perform restriction and ligation using OpenCloning?

You can separate the restriction and ligation steps into two different reactions. This can be useful if:

* You want to make sure you are picking the right subfragment of DNA for ligation.
* You want to use a restriction fragment for something else. For instance, to transform a cell.

For that, click on the plus icon below a sequence in the `Cloning` tab and select `Restriction`. Then, select the input sequences in the `Restriction inputs` field, as well as the enzyme you want to use (you can use more than one). If there are multiple products from the restriction, you will be shown a selector like below. Select the product you want to use and click `Choose product`.
