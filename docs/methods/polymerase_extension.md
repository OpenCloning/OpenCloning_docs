# Polymerase extension of overhangs

## What is polymerase extension of overhangs?

Polymerase extension of overhangs is the process of filling in the 3' overhangs of a partially double‑stranded molecule with a DNA polymerase. This is tipically used after [Oligonucleotide hybridization](./oligonucleotide_hybridization.md) as part of [Templateless PCR](./templateless_pcr.md).

After oligonucleotides are hybridized into a partially double‑stranded molecule with 5' overhangs, a DNA polymerase can fill in the 5' overhangs to create a fully double‑stranded product.

## How to plan polymerase extension using OpenCloning

Like any other cloning method, click on the plus icon below a sequence with 5' overhangs in the `Cloning` tab and select `Polymerase extension`.

OpenCloning simulates the fill‑in step and outputs the fully double‑stranded sequence with no internal single‑stranded regions.
